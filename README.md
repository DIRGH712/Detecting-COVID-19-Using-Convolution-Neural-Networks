# Covid-19 detection using Convolution Neural Networks
During the time of this global pandemic, detecting patients having COVID-19 symptoms at an early with the assistance of deep learning models can be a useful method. Here I explored various Deep learning models for the implementation of image classification and eventually detect the virus. A huge dataset of X-ray pictures of the chest, consisting of three different types namely: Normal, COVID-19, and Viral pneumonia is used. Models like InceptionV3, AlexNet, ResNets, and a self-made CNN have been trained to achieve this task. CNN showed an accuracy of about 96%, while v3 showed over 99%. Both showed a similar validation accuracy of 97.8%
